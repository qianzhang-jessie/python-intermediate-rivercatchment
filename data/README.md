# Lowland Catchment Research (LOCAR) Data

The data included here are taken from the [LOCAR](https://catalogue.ceh.ac.uk/documents/db9f6ef9-9512-4f39-aca3-3c55f51a7487) collection. These are continuous measurements of rainfall and river metrics for 6 measurement sites during December 2015. The data is released under the [Open Government Licence](https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/)

The full datasets are available to download from [EIDC](https://www.eidc.ac.uk/), following the DOI's given in the references below.
